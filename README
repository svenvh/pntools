PNTools

This directory contains various experimental tools for use with PN/ISA. Most
likely any tool found in here is in a very premature state, with a strong
dependence on the current phase of the moon.




Compilation Instructions
========================
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-pngen=XXX --with-isa=YYY
  Replace XXX with your pngen top level directory (i.e., the directory
  containing SUIF, Syck, etc.).
  Replace YYY with the your directory (containing pn, pn2espam etc.).
make




Adding New Tools
================
1. Open up Makefile.am and add appropriate _LDADD, _SOURCES lines. Add the tool
   executable name to bin_PROGRAMS.
2. Rerun autogen.sh, configure and make.
3. Add your tool to the list below. :-)




Current Tools
=============
This is a list of tools currently included in this directory. If you add a new
tool, please add an appropriate description to this list as well.


pdg1ana
-------
  Purpose: Example of how to extract information from a PDG.
  Authors: Sven van Haastregt
  Tested:  ISA 0.10


pdg1trans
---------
  Purpose: Integrates work of BSc. student Giso Dal, who worked on implementing
           modulo unfolding and plane cutting transformations.
  Authors: Giso Dal, Sven van Haastregt
  Notes:   Result may be plain wrong. See thesis for restrictions.
  Tested:  ISA 0.10


pn2ppn
------
  Purpose: Converts a PDG (generated by pn) to a PPN. This PPN is equivalent to
           the XML that is generated by pn2espam. The intent of this new PPN
           class is to provide a convenient framework for PPN analysis.
  Authors: Sven van Haastregt
  Tested:  ISA 0.10


ppnta
-----
  Purpose: Do some throughput analysis on a PPN.
  Authors: Teddy Zhai, Sven van Haastregt
  Notes:   Under development.
  Tested:  ISA 0.10
